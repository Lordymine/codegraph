# Changelog

All notable changes to codegraph are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (pre-1.0: minor
versions may include breaking changes).

## [Unreleased]

- `HTTP_CALLS` (client call-site → route) and a committable `graph.db.zst` team
  artifact are planned for a future release (M6); see `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-20

First public release. codegraph indexes a Go or TypeScript/JavaScript repository
into a token-efficient knowledge graph and serves it to AI coding agents over MCP.
Validated on real repositories of both stacks.

### Added

- **Graph store** — two-table SQLite (`nodes`, `edges`) + FTS5, pure-Go driver
  (no cgo for storage). Compact TSV wire format for every query (≈16× fewer tokens
  than a grep-driven agent on the conservative baseline).
- **Definitions (M1)** — tree-sitter ASTs → `File`/`Function`/`Method`/`Class`/
  `Interface`/`Type`/`Enum`/`Variable` nodes with real end lines, export flags, and
  decorators. `IMPORTS` edges for TS/JS.
- **Type-checker-accurate calls (M2)** — `CALLS` edges via **scip-typescript**
  (TS/JS) and **go/packages + a VTA call graph** (Go). Honest precision: an edge
  whose endpoints aren't both real nodes is dropped, never guessed.
- **Incremental indexing (M3)** — per-file sha256; a no-op when nothing changed;
  CALLS re-resolution gated to the scopes whose files changed. `detect_changes`.
- **Similarity + enrichment (M4)** — `SIMILAR_TO` near-clones (MinHash + LSH), the
  `similar` and `dead_code` queries, and cyclomatic complexity in node properties.
- **MCP polish + distribution (M5)** — the `mcp` server auto-indexes in the
  background with a readiness gate (works on any repo, no manual step);
  `codegraph install` registers the server into Claude Code, Codex, and opencode;
  `get_architecture` returns a one-shot repo map (languages, packages, hotspots);
  NestJS HTTP `Route` nodes from decorators.
- **Discovery** honors hard-ignores, `.gitignore`, and `.cbmignore`.
- **Tooling** — `index`, `stats`, `changes`, `install`, `mcp`, `bench`, `quality`,
  and `cli` subcommands; an MCP stdio server exposing all query tools.

### Quality

- Answer-quality harness (`docs/QUALITY.md`): graph mode reaches ~89–94% of an
  independent oracle at ~4.5–8× fewer tokens than a grep-driven agent. Go callers
  ~100% intra-repo (cobra, gh-cli); TS ~89%.
